# Smoke-and-fire-detection
Fire-Detection-System-IoT This project is a smart fire detection system that senses both smoke and flame, and sends real-time alerts and visual data using IoT integration. The system was built using an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, and I also designed a custom PCB to make it compact and hardware-ready.
